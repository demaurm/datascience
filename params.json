Facetiously, it is just another trending American buzzword (okay, buzz-term) to satisfy the whims of business realm inhabitants with short attention spans. In short, it is the glorified union of statistics and computational technology. In general, one could say that Data Science describes the methods of gathering and relating data, distilling them into useful forms, and applying them effectively and accurately to solve relevant problems. Beautiful data visualizations, when displayed appropriately, can facilitate the communication of the results cogently.\r\n\r\nThough I poke fun at the existence of the new science, it is not without genuine utility both etymologically and conceptually. It is sometimes temporally favorable for us to aggregate commonly associated sets of skills and processes into buzzwords. Such is the nature of human language. Like many interdisciplinary fields, the borders are blurry. As with anything, one should strive to define their own deep personal meaning of the term or at least attempt to be aware of their own usage of it.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a brief tour of other people’s interpretations of the emerging field. Unofficially, Google has so kindly described [their ideal candidates](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2015/11/how-to-get-job-at-google-as-data.html). The first bullet point stresses math and statistics: no surprise there. Our first glimpse of technological integration shines with the highlight of machine learning. We could spend years discussing the many facets of machine learning. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider this as the portion of the Data Science process that helps embed statistics into an adaptable software application. Sometimes it can generate some [pretty amazing pieces of art](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html).\r\n\r\nA great example: LinkedIn utilizing user profile data to predict networking between users.\r\nThree catalysts appear to have driven the emergence of data science and they revolve around the idea of “big data.” \r\nThe existence of significantly large amounts of data that cannot be processed by traditional means. \r\nThe fact that core business data is not always attained or stored in a structural format (i.e. relational database tables).\r\nA realization that solving complex problems requires the integration of various disparate data sources.\r\n[https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)\r\n\r\nThe skillset of a data scientist tends to include a combination of technologies that approach these challenges.\r\n\r\nI was curious as to what job descriptions for data scientists typically care about. At first, I thought I would just do a quick search on some websites like GlassDoor, Monster, and LinkedIn. I realized my sample size was limited by my viewing rate. I decided to apply a little of my own data science. Most web-based companies like these provide web APIs to access their services. After exploring a dozen sites and finding out that most APIs require purchasing a contract, I found that Indeed.com allows searching through their RESTful API. I also found that GlassDoor has some interesting aggregate data available from a public API, though no search function.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was to tabulate a keyword frequency histogram. I wanted to know which skills were most sought after when posting a data scientist job.\r\n\r\n(list of keywords)\r\n(histogram)\r\n\r\nWhile data science may be considered a trending job with increasing demand, it doesn’t seem very “sexy” to me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to be a prude and I am okay with breaking taboos. I enjoy data, statistics, and coding, but I just don’t have the same feelings for them.\r\n\r\n### (Next topic TBD)\r\n",
