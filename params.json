In short, it is the glorified union of statistics and computational technology. In general, one could say that Data Science describes the methods of gathering and relating data, distilling them into useful forms, and applying them effectively and accurately to solve relevant problems. Beautiful data visualizations, when displayed appropriately, can facilitate the communication of the results cogently.\r\n\r\nThough I poke fun at the existence of the new science, it is not without genuine utility both etymologically and conceptually. It is sometimes temporally favorable for us to aggregate commonly associated sets of skills and processes into buzzwords. Such is the nature of human language. Like many interdisciplinary fields, the borders of definition are blurry. As with anything, one should strive to define their own deep personal meaning of the term or at least attempt to be aware of their own usage of it.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a brief tour of other people’s interpretations of the emerging field. Unofficially, Google has so kindly described [their ideal candidates](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2015/11/how-to-get-job-at-google-as-data.html). The first bullet point stresses math and statistics: no surprise there. The article goes on to emphasize the importance of breadth in coding skills. Our first glimpse of technological integration shines with the highlight of machine learning. We could spend years discussing the many facets of machine learning. For the sake of brevity, let us consider this as the step in the process that helps embed statistics and prediction into software. Sometimes it can generate some [pretty amazing pieces of art](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html). Creativity also play quite an important role in data science. As Einstein put it: \"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThree catalysts appear to have driven the [emergence of data science](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) and they revolve around the idea of “big data.” \r\n\r\n1. The existence of significantly large amounts of data that cannot be processed by traditional means. \r\n2. The fact that relevant data is not always attained or stored in a structured format.\r\n3. A realization that solving complex problems requires the integration of various data sources.\r\n\r\nThe progression of LinkedIn as a business networking web application is a great example of successfully applied data science. A need to spur the social interaction of the users served as motivation for experimentation. The breakthrough concept was in suggesting contacts that a user would likely know or meet. Using existing profile data, prediction models were made. The success of this technique impacted the industry. It is not uncommon to log in to a social networking website that spams you with \"suggested friends\" and the like.\r\n\r\nI was curious as to what is most common among data scientist job descriptions. My first idea was to determine keyword frequency. I wanted to know which skills and backgrounds were most sought after. I found that [Indeed](http://indeed.com) allows searching through their [RESTful API service](http://www.indeed.com/jsp/apiinfo.jsp). I tried others like [GlassDoor](http://glassdoor.com), [Monster](http://monster.com), and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com). They don't offer a public service API, though GlassDoor does has some interesting aggregate data services available.\r\n\r\n(insert barchart here)\r\n\r\n### (Next topic TBD)\r\n",
